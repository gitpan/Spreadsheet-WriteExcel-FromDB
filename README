DESCRIPTION
    This module exports a database table as an Excel Spreadsheet.

    The data is not returned in any particular order, as it is a simple task
    to perform this in Excel. However, you may choose to ignore certain
    columns, using the 'ignore_columns' method.

METHODS
  read
    Creates a spreadsheet object from a database handle and a table name.

  dbh / table
    Accessor / mutator methods for the database handle and table name.

  restrict_rows
      $ss->restrict_rows('age > 10');

    An optional 'WHERE' clause for restricting the rows returned from the
    database.

  ignore_columns
      $ss->ignore_columns(qw/foo bar/);

    Output all columns, except these ones, to the spreadsheet.

  include_columns
      $ss->include_columns(qw/foo bar/);

    Only include these columns into the spreadsheet.

  as_xls
      print $ss->as_xls;

    Return the table as an Excel spreadsheet.

  write_xls
            $ss->write_xls('spreadsheet.xls');

    Write the table to a spreadsheet with the given filename.
